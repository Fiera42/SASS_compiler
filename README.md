# SASS_compiler
A SASS compiler made in java for school using ANTLR

## About

This repository contain ANTLR exercices I worked on for school as well as a SASS compiler (available in `src/scss/src`), this is mostly to keep track of my work and not meant to be a clean, public compiler. To see what it can do, please run the tests (not all of them pass, as they use a good chunk of SASS possibilities)
